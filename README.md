# Overview

This is the client for an assessment that was sent to me by the wonderful people of SovTech, it was a full-stack assessment requireming me to develop both the api and client. You can find the api repository at [SovTech Api](https://github.com/CorrieGra/sovtech-api).

## The Challenge 

1. You should develop a React Single Page App (SPA)
2. Your SPA should consume the above GraphQL API
3. Your SPA should have a Home page listing the first page of People as queried from the above GraphQL API.
4. Additionally there should be pagination implemented allowing for a particular People page to be Queried when a page number is selected
5. When a Person is clicked on, a Detail page outlining the Person's details should be displayed, in a thoughtful (styled) manner.
6. The User should be able to navigate back to the Home page to the previously active People page from the Detail page
